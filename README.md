Implementation of pixel manipulation by image encryption
Pixel manipulation in image encryption involves altering the color values of individual pixels within an image to obscure its content.
One common technique is to perform bitwise operations, such as XOR, on the pixel values using a secret key. 
This process modifies the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values of each pixel, making it difficult to discern the original image without the decryption key.
By manipulating pixels in this way, the encrypted image retains its visual appearance but is transformed in a manner that protects its content from unauthorized access. 
However, it's essential to note that such basic pixel manipulation techniques may not provide robust security against sophisticated attacks and are typically used for simple encryption purposes.
